# Simple-Caluculator
ðŸ§® A simple calculator built using Python.  My first Python project to perform basic arithmetic operations using user input.

ðŸ“Œ Features

- Console-based calculator
- Handles:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
  - Power (`**`)
- Simple and clean if-else logic

ðŸ§  How It Works

The program asks the user to enter two numbers and the operation symbol. It then performs the calculation and shows the result.

âœ… Example:
Enter First Number: 5 ( input )
Enter Second Number: 10 (input )
Enter the operation Required: " + "
Output: 15
